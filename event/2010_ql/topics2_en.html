					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Panel Ⅲ: SMEs Breaking out of the Financing Dilemma</span><br>
					　　Capital is an important resource to sustain the existence of SMEs. Hit by the financial crisis, numerous SMEs in China have closed down, largely due to gaps in cash flow. “Funding shortage” has become one of the bottlenecks in SMEs’ development. The major problem with financing is that SMEs find it hard to obtain loans, due to biased national policies, high borrowing cost and lack of guarantee. A multi-level capital market is therefore a necessary solution to the financing dilemma faced by SMEs. How to resolve the financing dilemma? What workable measures can the government adopt to help with SMEs’ financing? What customized solutions can commercial banks offer? What financing channels should enterprises choose in different stages of development? Can capital facilitate corporate management? Professionals in venture capital, PE, banks and other financial institutions, as well as senior officials from county-level governments in Yangzi River Delta – the cradle for China’s SMEs will discuss with entrepreneurs on how to tackle the financing challenge. <br>
