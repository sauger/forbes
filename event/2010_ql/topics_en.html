<span style="font-weight:bold;">Panel Ⅰ: Industries with Biggest Investment Value and Development Potential in China</span><br>
					　　The structural imbalance of China’s economy has been laid bare by the financial crisis. The export-oriented economy leads to over-reliance on overseas markets. As a result, the falling international demand has hit China’s export trade and a considerable part of export service industry very hard. Indeed, industrial restructuring has never been more urgent. Industries such as renewable energy, new materials, energy conservation, environmental protection, bio-pharmaceutical, consumer goods & retail and TMT have drawn the attention of investors and start-up entrepreneurs. The rise of emerging industries without state monopoly will facilitate the development of SMEs and industrial restructuring and upgrading. How can we further product R & D and commercialization (which will have a huge impact on future economic competiveness)? How can we seize investment opportunities in these new industries? Successful investors will share their experience in making investment choices.<br>
