					　　In responding to the financial crisis, the Chinese government adopted the most aggressive measures ever to support the economy in 2009, including an expansionary lending policy, a 4-trillion stimulus package, plans to revitalize ten industries, and a 500-billion structural tax cut program. The financial tsunami is still unraveling the global economy. Data indicates, however, China’s economy is bottoming out, though the country still has a long way to go to full recovery.  <br>
					　　The most dynamic component in China’s economy, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have gone through rigorous tests- cash flow stress, funding shortage, falling international demand, weak domestic demand, volatile raw material prices, rising labor cost, among others. Despite their major contributions to Corporate China’s size as well as the country’s job opportunities, sales, export and tax revenue, SMEs are still the disadvantaged relative to their large counterparts. To survive and develop, they must overcome more obstacles, let alone enjoy favorable bailout from the government. 2010 will continue to see the global economy on its way to recovery. At the same time, a new economic landscape is taking shape. However, a lot of difficulties and uncertainties are still awaiting Chinese SMEs. <br>
					　　In such a time of transition, Forbes China, a popular financial magazine committed to building wealth creation tools and promoting entrepreneurship, believes that only enterprises and entrepreneurs with a mind for real innovation and change and knowledge of tapping their own potential to find the right resources are capable of overcoming all obstacles, turning the crisis into opportunities. The Forbes China · CITI 2010 China Best SME Investment and Development Forum to be held on March, 2010 will gather established economists, business and investment leaders, and founders of enterprises which have made Forbes China's List of “Best SME” to decode the dire situation of SMEs and discuss ways for SMEs to bolster innovation and development against current economic difficulties.<br><br>
