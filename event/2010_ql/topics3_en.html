					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Panel Ⅴ: From Start-Up to 1 Billion</span><br>
					　　SMEs have taken on momentous challenges from start-up to growth and expansion. Only by becoming an elephant can you influence the market and crush the barriers. Being bigger and stronger is the objective of most enterprises. But unsustainable business model, lack of innovation, messy management and talent shortage has constrained their ability to further expansion. Given the changing global economic environment, strategic consolidation has become enterprises’ shortcut to being bigger and stronger. How does strategic consolidation help enterprises effectively integrate advantages and resources and restructure business? How can an enterprise build a sound management model and corporate system to achieve healthy development? Founders of enterprises which have made Forbes China’s Lists of “Best SMEs” and have since grown bigger and stronger will discuss with management consultants on ways for enterprises to make breakthroughs in their development.<br>

					　　Family business is a force we cannot afford to ignore in China’s private sector. A majority of SMEs have grown from family business. Many family enterprises are tenacious and competitive and have made great accomplishments in early stages. But very often, their management cannot catch up with corporate development and expansion, severely restraining their further development. Some have even disappeared from the market. Expansion challenges the once-effective management model; entrepreneurs, therefore, must respond quickly and adapt their business and management model to development. What type of management model should family business choose in different development stages? How can family business break management bottlenecks? Representatives of famous family enterprises in China and management consultants will work together to find out ways to achieve breakthroughs in family business management. <br>
